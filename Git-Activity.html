    <h2>Baker Mayfield Bio</h2>

    <p>Baker Reagan Mayfield (born April 14, 1995) is an American football quarterback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). Mayfield began his college football career as a walk-on player for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Mayfield transferred from Texas Tech to play for the Sooners of Oklahoma following supposed scholarship issues and a lack of communication with coaches. After sitting out the 2014 season due to NCAA transfer rules, Mayfield won the starting quarterback job in 2015. He won several awards for his performance as a senior in 2017, including the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Award, and unanimous All-America recognition.
Mayfield was drafted by the Browns first overall in the 2018 NFL Draft. In his first NFL appearance, Mayfield led Cleveland to their first win in 19 games, ending a 635-day winless streak. He threw 27 touchdowns in his 13 starts for the Browns in 2018, breaking the rookie-season passing-TD record of 26 held by Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson (Justin Herbert broke the record two years later). In 2020, he led the Browns to both their first playoff berth and playoff win since 2002, and their first winning season since 2007.</p>
